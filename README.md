This is a portfolio showing four projects that I have worked on. Surf & Paddle is an HTML & CSS exercise with the intent of completely recreating a mock-up of a site page. Color Clock takes the current time and translates it into a hexidecimal color. To Do RPG is a task tracker that allows the user to add tasks to a day and assign points for their completion, helping the user be accountable for their daily tasks and rewarding them for completion. starterTech is a project from a graphic design class. It's a mock-up for a site that doesn't yet exist.
