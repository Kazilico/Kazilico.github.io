				<p class="bio1">Coding has become a third career path for me. With over a decade spent in the printing industry and five years as a pastry cook and baker in restaurants and bakeries around D.C., I've decided to learn coding.</p>
				<p class="bio2">As difficult as I've found the transition into coding, I'm still excited about the possibility. I now have a skillset that I can use to help people. I can build things that make people's lives easier. This is my goal: to code for betterment of humanity.</p>
				<p class="bio3">Aside from coding, I'm married with three bizarre dogs. I'm a prequel defender, a home rehabilitator, and a die-hard St. Louis Cardinals fan. Go Cards!</p>
				<p class="bio4">If you're wondering where the name Kazilico comes from, I made it up. It's a combination of my wife's last name, Kazil, and my own, Carrico. I thought that we could make this <bolder>our</bolder> last name, but she declined. Now it's my business name.</p>
